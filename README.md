                                            Automated Drone Sentry 86 Project 
Author: Abhay Ravi Chandran 

Introduction: 
    This project is a hobby project that I worked on to create a sentry drone that can act like a personal drone assistant. This project was created to have AI based intelligence added to the Drone. This REadme talks about the differnt parts of this project. 

Requirements:
The Requirements folder consists of all the requirement documentation I added while coming up with the drone design. The documentation consists of the basic requirements broken down into individual requirement IDs that as used to associate in the design. It consists of a Software Architecture Document that details each high level component of the drone and the individual breakdown of all the separate modules. The Hardware Requirements consist of how the drone would be build from different hardware components and how they will be assmebled together to get the drone. 

Source:
This folder has the Source code to build the BSP for the drone. It has 2 folders \
1) Project Hover: The BSP for the Drone in YOCTO project. 
2) Hover App: The application that runs the drone logic in the embedded linux space.
